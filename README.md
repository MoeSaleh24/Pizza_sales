I was inspired by the YouTuber 'Data Tutorials' to build this project for my portfolio, focusing on  SQL. 
I gained a comprehensive understanding of how SQL is used in data analytics, including querying databases and extracting valuable insights. 
Moreover, I expanded my skill set by creating an interactive dashboard using Tableau, which improved my ability to visualize and communicate data-driven narratives.
